<h2>OOP1 Assignment (25%)</h2>

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to apply the learning from the module to build a Java application demonstrating features from the latest Java LTS (Java 21). The application is expected to cover the following language features from the module:
Fundamentals:
•	classes
o	contrast this() and this.
o	method overloading
o	varargs
o	LVTI
•	encapsulation
•	interfaces
•	inheritance
o	overriding and polymorphism
o	contrast super() and super.
•	exceptions (checked and unchecked)
•	enums
•	arrays
•	use of Java Core API (String, StringBuilder, List/ArrayList, Date API)

Advanced:
•	call-by-value and defensive copying
•	private, default and static interface methods
•	records
•	a custom immutable type
•	lambdas (Predicate)
o	discussion of ‘final’ or ‘effectively final’
o	method references
•	switch expressions and pattern matching
•	sealed classes and interfaces

Extra marks:
•	any topics from Java 22 and/or 23 - be sure to clearly explain these topics and what you had to do to get the newer code to compile/run
•	consistent updates to a public repository  
Application Domain
You are free to select your own domain. Please select a domain that makes sense e.g. a car park/restaurant application.

Deadline
1700 Friday 29th November (end week 12). If you cannot submit on that date due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, you will have to request a deferral by emailing eng@tus.ie. A live Q&A via zoom may be scheduled after the submission date if seemed necessary - you will be notified by student email if this is the case. The zip to upload should contain your report, code and screencast.


What to submit
Report	A brief introduction to the application.
	List of user stories completed.
	Evaluation - evaluation (1-2 pages) of how well you adhered to the project brief and any problems encountered.
Code	Your source code 
Video screencast	Brief overview of your architecture (UML diagram)
	Demo of all your user stories
	Max. time is 10 mins
	Ensure you annotate your video accordingly; the better explained it is, the easier it is to give marks.
	Audio quality is very important.
 
Marking rubric
Elements	Excellent (75+)	Good (55%-75%)	Satisfactory 
(40%-55%)	Fail (0-39%)
Presentation quality
(20%)	Excellent audio. 
Presentation demonstrates adequate preparation. Content is presented in a coherent and logical fashion. Appropriate use of visual annotations.	Good audio. 
Presentation demonstrates adequate preparation. Content is presented in a coherent and logical fashion. 	Good audio. 
Presentation demonstrates adequate preparation.	Poor audio.
Presenter does not adhere to the maximum time limit.
Application demo (user stories/requirements)
(60%)	Presenter demonstrated a complete application (both fundamentals and advanced language features). 
Excellent understanding of the application and language features used.	Presenter demonstrated a more complete application (not all language features implemented). 
Good understanding of the application and language features used.	Presenter demonstrated an application with a good level of functionality (all fundamental language features implemented).
Good understanding of the application and language features used.	Presenter demonstrated minimal or no functionality at all. Very few fundamental language features implemented. 
Weak understanding of the application and language features used.
Code quality (10%)	Code is of a very high standard and is very easy to follow.	Code is of a high standard and easy to follow.	Code is of a good standard and relatively straightforward.	Code is of a low standard and hard to follow.
Evaluation (10%)	Application evaluated against the project brief.
Java 22/23 used.
Consistent repo updates.	Application evaluated against the project brief.	Minimal or no evaluation.	No evaluation done.
